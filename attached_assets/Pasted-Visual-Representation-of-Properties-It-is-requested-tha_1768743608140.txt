Visual Representation of Properties:
It is requested that the property development status be visually represented on the game board using a green house icon 🏠 for houses and a red hotel icon 🏨 for hotels. This representation should replace the use of green and red dots in order to provide a clearer and more intuitive distinction between different building levels on land squares.
Mortgage Icon:
It is required that a standardized document icon 📃 be used to indicate the mortgage status of a property. The icon should be clearly displayed on the corresponding land square, replacing the traditional letter “M” to improve visual clarity and consistency.
Player Name Display:
It is requested that the full name of the player be displayed on the land squares associated with their owned properties instead of using only the initial. This change is intended to improve readability and reduce ambiguity in property ownership, especially in multiplayer scenarios.
Compatibility with Various Screens and Devices:
The game interface should be designed according to responsive design principles to ensure compatibility across various screen sizes and device types, including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers, while preserving usability and visual consistency.
Get Out of Jail in the Exchange Window:
It is requested that the “Get Out of Jail” card be available within the Exchange Window and selectable in both the “You Offer” and “You Request” lists. This will allow players to include the card in trade negotiations and support more flexible strategic exchanges.
Sound Effects for Financial Transactions:
It is required that distinct sound effects be implemented for debit and credit transactions. These audio cues should enhance player feedback, increase immersion, and contribute to a more engaging gameplay experience.
Improved Balance Display:
It is requested that the font size of the balance display in the user interface be increased to ensure better visibility and readability across different devices and viewing conditions.
Land Ownership Status Display:
It is required that the ownership status of each land square, whether mortgaged or freehold, be clearly displayed within the Land Information window. This will enable players to make informed strategic decisions based on accurate and transparent property status information.
