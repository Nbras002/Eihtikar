I want you to design and develop a fully functional online multiplayer board game inspired by "Monopoly" named Eihtikar, with the following detailed specifications. The game should be in Arabic and should have a professional and polished structure, suitable for online play. Please include code, architecture suggestions, and clear instructions for implementation.

1- Game Interface
- All text, labels, buttons, and messages must be in Arabic.
- The game board should have 40 tiles, including properties, stations, chance/community cards, and special tiles like Jail, Free Parking, or Rewards.
- Each property tile must display its name, cost, and rent clearly.
- Include simple and visually appealing graphics for tiles, player tokens, and other game elements.
- Use responsive design so the game works on both desktop and mobile browsers.
2- Multiplayer and Online Functionality
-Players can join private rooms, each with a unique room ID or name.
-Maximum of 4-6 players per room.
-Each room should have a room owner (manager) with special privileges.
-Players can see real-time updates of all moves, money balances, and property ownership.
-Implement WebSocket communication for real-time gameplay and chat.
3- Room Manager Features
The room owner can:
-Start or restart the game.
-Add or remove players.
-Set initial money for all players.
-Enable/disable certain game rules or special tiles.
-Monitor player status and game events.
4- Game Mechanics
- The system of throwing one dice for player movement (1-6 per turn) or two dice (2-12 per turn) at the choice of the room host.
- Players can buy, sell, or trade properties with other players.
- Rent payments must be automatically calculated and deducted.
- Include Chance and Community Chest cards with random events like Jail, bonus money, or penalties.

- Simple sound effects for dice rolls, property purchases, and notifications.
- Game settings editable by the room manager, such as initial money, game speed, or custom house rules.
7- Technical Specifications
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optionally React or Vue for better structure).
- Backend: Node.js (Express).
- Database: supabase.com, suitable database to store rooms, player data, and game state.
- Real-time Communication: WebSockets (Socket.IO recommended) to handle live multiplayer interactions.
- Ensure the code is modular, clean, and well-commented for easy maintenance and future development.
- Provide clear instructions on how to run the game locally and deploy it online.
8- Deliverables
